Technical Specification (TS) – Betting Odds Analyzer
1. Project Overview

The Betting Odds Analyzer is a small application designed to help users evaluate and compare betting odds from different bookmakers. The program calculates implied probability, checks for value bets, and gives a basic assessment of whether a bet might be statistically reasonable.
The tool is intended for informational purposes only and does not provide betting advice.

2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Odds Input

The program must allow users to:

Enter odds manually (decimal format, e.g., 1.75).

Add multiple outcomes (e.g., Team A win, Team B win, Draw).

Optionally load odds from an external API (if available).

2.2 Core Calculations

The system must calculate:

Implied probability for each outcome.

Formula: 1 / odds

Total market margin (to detect bookmaker overround).

Value bet indicator based on user’s own estimated winning probability.

Expected value (EV) of the bet:

EV = (probability * odds) - 1

2.3 Analysis Output

The tool should display:

Implied probability for each outcome

Overround percentage

Expected value (positive or negative)

Simple labels like:

“Possible value bet”

“Neutral bet”

“Negative EV – avoid”

2.4 UI Requirements

Clear input fields for odds and user probability.

Table showing calculations for each outcome.

Color-coded EV indicator:

Green: positive EV

Yellow: neutral

Red: negative EV

Optional: add chart displaying changes in odds over time.

3. Non-Functional Requirements
3.1 Platform

Desktop app (Python) or web-based version.

3.2 Performance

Calculations must run instantly (under 0.2 seconds).

Interface must remain responsive even with multiple outcomes.

3.3 Reliability

If API fails or data is missing, the program should revert to manual mode.

Should validate inputs and warn the user if values are invalid.

3.4 Legal & Safety

Must show a disclaimer stating:
“This tool is for educational purposes only and does not provide betting advice.”

4. Recommended Tech Stack
Option A – Python Desktop

Python

Tkinter or PyQt

Requests (for API access)

Pandas (for data handling)

Option B – Web App

HTML/CSS/JavaScript

Chart.js for visualizations

Fetch API for loading odds data

5. Possible Future Improvements

Auto-detection of arbitrage opportunities

Multi-bookmaker comparison

Live odds tracking

Alerts for large odds changes

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the title and description.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create a new file with the logo generation instructions.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
