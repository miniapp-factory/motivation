+Code the following app
+```
+Technical Specification (TS) – Betting Odds Analyzer
+1. Project Overview
+
+The Betting Odds Analyzer is a small application designed to help users evaluate and compare betting odds from different bookmakers. The program calculates implied probability, checks for value bets, and gives a basic assessment of whether a bet might be statistically reasonable.
+The tool is intended for informational purposes only and does not provide betting advice.
+
+2. Functional Requirements
+2.1 Odds Input
+
+The program must allow users to:
+
+Enter odds manually (decimal format, e.g., 1.75).
+
+Add multiple outcomes (e.g., Team A win, Team B win, Draw).
+
+Optionally load odds from an external API (if available).
+
+2.2 Core Calculations
+
+The system must calculate:
+
+Implied probability for each outcome.
+
+Formula: 1 / odds
+
+Total market margin (to detect bookmaker overround).
+
+Value bet indicator based on user’s own estimated winning probability.
+
+Expected value (EV) of the bet:
+
+EV = (probability * odds) - 1
+
+2.3 Analysis Output
+
+The tool should display:
+
+Implied probability for each outcome
+
+Overround percentage
+
+Expected value (positive or negative)
+
+Simple labels like:
+
+“Possible value bet”
+
+“Neutral bet”
+
+“Negative EV – avoid”
+
+2.4 UI Requirements
+
+Clear input fields for odds and user probability.
+
+Table showing calculations for each outcome.
+
+Color-coded EV indicator:
+
+Green: positive EV
+
+Yellow: neutral
+
+Red: negative EV
+
+Optional: add chart displaying changes in odds over time.
+
+3. Non-Functional Requirements
+3.1 Platform
+
+Desktop app (Python) or web-based version.
+
+3.2 Performance
+
+Calculations must run instantly (under 0.2 seconds).
+
+Interface must remain responsive even with multiple outcomes.
+
+3.3 Reliability
+
+If API fails or data is missing, the program should revert to manual mode.
+
+Should validate inputs and warn the user if values are invalid.
+
+3.4 Legal & Safety
+
+Must show a disclaimer stating:
+“This tool is for educational purposes only and does not provide betting advice.”
+
+4. Recommended Tech Stack
+Option A – Python Desktop
+
+Python
+
+Tkinter or PyQt
+
+Requests (for API access)
+
+Pandas (for data handling)
+
+Option B – Web App
+
+HTML/CSS/JavaScript
+
+Chart.js for visualizations
+
+Fetch API for loading odds data
+
+5. Possible Future Improvements
+
+Auto-detection of arbitrage opportunities
+
+Multi-bookmaker comparison
+
+Live odds tracking
+
+Alerts for large odds changes
+```
